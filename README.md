# Express.js Async Middleware Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications related to asynchronous middleware and provides a solution.

## The Problem

Asynchronous operations (database queries, API calls, etc.) within Express middleware often require proper handling to prevent errors.  Failure to handle async operations correctly can lead to unexpected behavior, including unhandled promise rejections.

The `bug.js` file shows an example where an async operation isn't correctly handled.  This can lead to errors that might not be obvious, especially in larger applications. 

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct way to handle asynchronous operations within Express middleware, ensuring proper error handling and preventing unexpected behavior. This involves correctly handling promises or using async/await for cleaner code.
